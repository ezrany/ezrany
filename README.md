# Hi, I'm Ezra! 👋

👋 I'm a Data Analyst who loves to dive into data and extract valuable insights.

👀 My passion lies in Data and Business Analytics, where I leverage tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI for data analysis, manipulation, and visualisation.

🌱 When I'm not in front of my computer, you'll likely find me pursuing my hobbies - capturing moments through photography 📸, creating visual stories through video 🎥, watching my favorite series 📺, or kicking a ball around ⚽.
